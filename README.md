# multiplayer-test-help

I really need help with this. I'm new to making multiplayer.

I followed this tutorial: https://youtu.be/FHBJ-auzaeM but now for whatever reason it just won't work.

There might be formatting issues in the main.gd code and player.gd code since I pasted them to preserve the code when I was tinkering and when I went to paste it back in, the code had unformatted itself.

I'm almost to the point of rewriting everything and starting fresh. Any help is appreciated.

Oh and Global.gd basically goes unused. It has a single variable that is never referenced in the current code.
